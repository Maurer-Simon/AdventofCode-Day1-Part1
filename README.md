## Advent of Code 2023 - Day 1
### Calibration Recovery Challenge
This C program tackles the first challenge, aiming to recover calibration values from lines of text. The solution involves extracting the first and last digits from each line and combining them to form two-digit numbers. The final result is the sum of these calibration values. Explore the code to witness the journey of solving this festive coding challenge! 🎄🌟

### Instructions:
The program takes input text lines, extracts digits, and calculates calibration values.
Compile the C code and run the executable to discover the calibrated sum.
Let the coding festivities begin! 🚀🔍 #AdventOfCode #ProgrammingChallenge #CProgramming #CodingAdventures
